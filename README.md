## ![About Us](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SJV0hNFu0.png)


  This project is a "Hotel Reservation" application that digitalizes the hotel reservation process. Users (guests and hotel managers) can register and log into the system. Hotel managers can add and update hotel and room information, while guests can search for available rooms based on date range and room type and make reservations. The system records reservations, offers online payment options, and automatically updates room availability. Features include notifications, reporting, user profile management, multi-language and currency support, security, feedback, and support. These features make the hotel reservation process more efficient and user-friendly for both guests and hotel managers.
